console.log('Hello world');

// Single thread can manage multiple connections very efficiently
// It gets possible because of non-blocking IO model
// Non-Blocking IO Model: It works on the principle that if one process is taking time to get complete, it will
// not block the whole thread instead it will execute next process and the previous process will resume when it is ready to go.
// This helps in handling more than one connections simultaneously in single thread only.

// npm: node package manager, it manages packages of node project (similar to pip in python)
